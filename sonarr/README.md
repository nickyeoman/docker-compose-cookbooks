Sonarr is a PVR (Personal Video Recorder) designed to automatically find, download, and manage your TV series collection. It monitors your favorite shows for new episodes and, once they are posted to your indexers, grabs them and sends them to your download client. After the download completes, Sonarr automatically renames the episode files to a clean and consistent format, sorts them into the appropriate series and season folders within your media library, and updates your media server (like Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby). It's also capable of searching for missing past episodes and automatically upgrading existing files to a higher quality when they become available, ensuring your collection is always complete and up-to-date.

 Prowlarr is an indexer manager and proxy developed by the *arr team to integrate with and support applications like Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, and Readarr. Its primary function is to centralize the management of your various torrent tracker and Usenet indexer configurations. Instead of manually adding and configuring each indexer in every single one of your *arr applications, you simply add them once to Prowlarr. Prowlarr then automatically syncs these indexers and their settings to all of your connected apps, drastically simplifying setup and maintenance while also providing a single dashboard to monitor the status and statistics of all your indexer sources.

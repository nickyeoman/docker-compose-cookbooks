Jellyseerr is a free and open-source software application for managing requests for your media library. As a fork of Overseerr, it's been adapted to work seamlessly with Jellyfin and Emby media servers. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface that allows your users to browse, discover, and request new movies and TV shows. Once a request is made and approved, Jellyseerr integrates with your existing *arr stack (Sonarr, Radarr) to automatically handle the searching and downloading of the requested content, streamlining the entire process of adding new media to your server.

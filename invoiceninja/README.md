# Invoice Ninja

Proxy port 80 to nginx.

You have to build this one
```
docker buildx build --no-cache -f Dockerfile -t invoiceninja .
```

This repo is just a slight modification of [the source](https://github.com/invoiceninja/dockerfiles/) you should go there for support.


I'm not a big fan of all the licensing and paywall features.
